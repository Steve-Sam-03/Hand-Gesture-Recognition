## Project Overview
Hand Gesture Recognition is a system that utilizes machine learning and image processing to recognize hand gestures in real-time. The system captures hand movements using a camera and classifies them into different gestures based on a pre-trained model.

The goal of this project is to create an efficient and accurate hand gesture recognition system that can be used for applications in areas such as:
- Virtual reality
- Robotics
- Human-computer interfaces
- Sign language interpretation

By capturing hand movements via a camera and classifying them with a trained model, the system provides real-time feedback to improve gesture recognition accuracy.

## Features
- Real-time hand gesture recognition using computer vision.
- Machine learning model for gesture classification.
- Integration with camera devices for live hand gesture capture.
- Can be customized with additional gesture sets or models.

## How to Install and Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Steve-Sam-03/Hand-Gesture-Recognition.git
   cd Hand-Gesture-Recognition
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:
   Make sure you have Python and pip installed, then run
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the application:
   Start the program to recognize hand gestures in real-time
   ```bash
   python final.py
   ```

## How to Use the Project
1. After running the project, it will access your camera and start capturing hand gestures.
2. The system will recognize gestures based on the pre-trained model.
3. You can train the model with custom gestures by adding new data and updating the model.

#### Example Commands
- To classify gestures from the webcam:
  ```bash
  python final.py --source webcam
  ```
- To retrain the model with new gesture data:
  ```bash
  python train_model.py --data ./custom_data
  ```
